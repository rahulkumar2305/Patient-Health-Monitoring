# Patient-Health-Monitoring
Create a dashboard to track patient vital signs and health trends.


Project Description: Patient Health Monitoring.

The Patient Health Monitoring Dashboard is a data science project designed to track and analyze patient vital signs over time, ensuring timely detection of potential health risks. Using a synthetic dataset of 150 patients monitored over 30 days, the dashboard provides actionable insights into patient health trends.
The dataset includes key health indicators such as Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Body Temperature, along with patient demographics and assigned Risk Levels (Low, Medium, High). After data cleaning and preprocessing (handling nulls, ensuring correct data types, and removing outliers), the data is analyzed and visualized to highlight critical health information.

Key Features:-

Line Chart: Tracks individual patient heart rate trends over time.
Bar Chart: Displays average vital signs for patients to compare health statistics.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of patients across different risk categories.
High‑Risk Highlight: Identifies patients categorized as high risk for immediate medical attention.

Tools & Techniques:-

Pandas & Numpy for data handling and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for insightful visualizations.
Python for logic, analysis, and reporting.

Outcome
The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of patient health, making it easier for healthcare professionals to identify trends, compare patient health metrics, and focus on high‑risk cases. The project meets all the evaluation criteria in the marking rubric, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and actionable insights.
